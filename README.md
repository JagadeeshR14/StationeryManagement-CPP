# STATIONERY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

## INTRODUCTION :
The effective management of resources is crucial for operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness. 
One such vital resource is stationery, the management of which can lead to significant inefficiencies and wastage if not handled properly. 
To address these challenges, a Stationery Management System (SMS) has been developed utilizing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Advanced Data Structures (ADS) concepts in C++.
Here each concepts were developed separately with separate outputs.

## PURPOSE AND SCOPE :
The primary purpose of this Stationery Management System is to streamline the process of managing stationery items within an organization. 
Ensuring that the supply of stationery items is consistently aligned with demand, thus minimizing both shortages and excesses.

## DEVELOPED :
This project is being used for study purposes in order to learn C++ using an effective example(Stationery management system).
This will cover every conceivable notion in the OOPS and ADS.
Every concept will have its own output-rich document file and a code file.

## PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE USED :
1. C++

## IMPLEMENTATION STEPS :
1. Download the [Program files](Program_files) from the repository.
2. And select which concept to run.
3. Then run the corresponding code file in VSCode or in a online compiler.
4. Give the corresponding inputs for the compiled code if needed.
5. Verify the code, Input and output from the [Document files.](Document_files)

## LABS :
There are totally 11-Labs were developed.
Each lab is a concept of OOPS and ADS.
Here the concept details were mentioned below.

## CONCLUSION :
The Stationery Management System (SMS) developed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Advanced Data Structures (ADS) concepts in C++ represents a significant advancement in the management of stationery resources within an organization. 
It leveraging the learning of every concepts in CPP(C++) with the stationery management system.
C++ has proven to be an excellent choice for the implementation of this system due to its powerful OOP capabilities, performance efficiency, and robust standard library. 
The language's support for advanced data structures and algorithms has enabled the development of a system that is both robust and flexible.
